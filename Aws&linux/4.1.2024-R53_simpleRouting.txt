1. Bought a Domain named kloudkratos.online from hostinger
2. Created a hosted zone on Route53 And Got 4 Nameservers
3. Attached the nameservers to Hostinger (It will take More time to propogate)
4. created  a instance and added apache2 and edited indexpage
5. in hosted zone added A-record for simple routing using Instance ip address
6. Then selected simple routing policy Bcoz we are going to add only one Server
7. Created a Record it takes 2 min to create 
8. then checked my domain in browser it lands to hostinger default parkdomin page
9. igot depressed Then finded a tool called dnschecker
1. dns checker provides a detail about propogation time and seen in india my site is still not propogated
2. In germany the site is propogated so i connected vpn to germany and checked the site url
3. it showed the content that i feeded in instance, now my doubt was cleared opreation success.
4. now deleted a hosted zone and instances.
