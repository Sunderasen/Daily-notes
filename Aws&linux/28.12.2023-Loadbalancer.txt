Loadbalancer 

it is used to speed the traffic equally to the servers 

in application loadbalancers we can able to use microservices if we have 5 micro services in our website 

we can able to set every sever for each micro services and can able to set the path and conditions for the microservices

Scenario:

there are four servers in our hand 2 is for main page two is for others now create loabalacner for ths servers and reate target group ..

in this case we need to create two target groups in first TG we have to add main page servers and select which index.html file we need to target. then create a app load balancer attach it to TG then check with that loadbalancer dns for thier working.

then create a Tg-2 add other microservice server set the path to be targeted then go to loadalancer add rule if path=/others*
condition = if the path reaches the particular condition send the traffic to the Tg-2 .

Now check with dns url with adding /others.html in the path..
